%Playing a bit around the propagation rules related to guard dependencies, I propose the following documents
%The seventh propagation rule address the difference in propagation non-null guards have related to null guards.

%This notably concerns the automatic drop of otherwise unbounded attributes. Basically, In a relation R:(x,y,z)
%onto which is held YZ != NULL and Y != NULL, if -(Y!=NULL) is held over S2, then Z, being ubounded should also drop as its non-null
%status is entierely dependenct on Y non-null.

%In fine, what we prove, I think, is that losing YZ in S2 does lead to the loss of information as a reverse mapping still prove entailment
