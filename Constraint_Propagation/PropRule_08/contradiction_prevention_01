%Playing a bit around the propagation rules related to guard dependencies, I propose the following documents
%Coming to the 8th propagation rule, we now tackle a redundancy difficult to avoid in our sequential methodology

%So, in a table R:(x,y,z,t) we have three constraint YZ = NULL, YT = NULL and ZT = NULL and we want to show... stuff
%Basically, if YZ and YT are both set to null, this should also set ZT to null

exists x exists y exists z exists t (R(x,y,z,t) -> (z = $F & t = $F)).

%MAPPINGS A TO B
