%We present a series of formula showing the effects of constraint propagation for each pair of FOL constraint/RA operator
%Starting with the propagation of a functional dependency Y -> Z after a left outer join

%We have Y->Z in R1, and we want to show that after left-outer-joining it with another relation R2, R1 R2 not in a total IND, we still kept all
%values present in R1.
%CONSTRAINT A
%Functional Dependency Y->Z
all x all y all z all x1 all z1 ((R1(x,y,z) & R1(x1,y,z1))-> z=z1).

%Inclusion Dependency ind=[R1,R2](Y,Y)
%all x all y (R2(x,y) -> exists z R1(y,z)).
%all y all z (R1(y,z) -> exists x R2(x,y)).

%MAPPINGS A TO B
%Freaky translation of the left outer join, the idea is to start from a basic join onto which we add via union each tuples in R1 not joined
%with R2
all x all y all z all t (R(x,y,z,t) <-> (R1(x,y,z) & R2(x,t)) | (R1(x,y,z) & -(R1(x,y,z) & R2(x,t)))).
