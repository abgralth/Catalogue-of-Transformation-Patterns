%We present a series of formula showing the effects of constraint propagation for each pair of FOL constraint/RA operator
%Starting with the propagation of a functional dependency Y -> Z after a left outer join

%We now have Y->Z in both tables R1, R2, and we're just having fun joining them

%MAPPINGS A TO B
