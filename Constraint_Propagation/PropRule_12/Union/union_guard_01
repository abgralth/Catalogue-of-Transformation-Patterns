%Moving onto binary operators, we here focus on the propagation of constraints under union

%Merging Guards should be pretty straigthforward
%Although, that being said, we can easily show the losslesness of the union in this situation, but somehow we have trouble proving that 
% exists x exists y exists z (R(x,y,z) -> -(x = cond)), something which should be true if one do the union of two tables, one in which x = cond
%and another in which -(x=cond), but whatever, the proof of losslessness seem stronger anyhow.

%So, the merge of two opposite conditions merge into a new one.
