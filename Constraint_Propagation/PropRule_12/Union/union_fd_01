%Moving onto binary operators, we here focus on the propagation of constraints under union

%If we keep the condition over X, then the goal of proving that such FD exists in R is false
%However, if we change the condition to be over Y instead, and only Y, or its component as the next proof shows, then it works.
%The reason is rather intitive as requiring Y to split mean that we can never get into a situation where S1(x1,y1,z1) and S2(x2,y1,z2) can
%exists.
%And yet, somehow the disjoint doesn't work. Although, it's not that surprising as the following pair would be disjoint, but still lead to
%a contradiction when merged together: S1(x1,y1,z1),S2(x2,y1,z2)
