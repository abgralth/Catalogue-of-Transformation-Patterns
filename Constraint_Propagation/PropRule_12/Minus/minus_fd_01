%We present a series of formula showing the effects of constraint propagation for each pair of FOL constraint/RA operator
%Starting with the propagation of a functional dependency Y -> Z after a set difference

%We start with one FD in both R1, R2 and see that their set difference preserves it in R
%Now, in truth this depends a lot of the population of R1 and R2 as R ranges from R1 to empty, but nevertheless the FD would still hold in R.
