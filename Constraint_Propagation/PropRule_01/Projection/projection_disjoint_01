%We present a series of formula showing the effects of constraint propagation for each pair of FOL constraint/RA operator
%Starting with the propagation of a disjoint[R1,R2]
%In this case, with no guard it is not possible to known from where the disjointness stem from, meaning that this constraint can only
%be propagated following a full projection. Otherwise, it is possible that removing either X, Y or Z might produce a counter-example.
