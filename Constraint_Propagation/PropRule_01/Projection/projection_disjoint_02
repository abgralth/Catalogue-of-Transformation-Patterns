%We present a series of formula showing the effects of constraint propagation for each pair of FOL constraint/RA operator
%Starting with the propagation of a disjoint[R1,R2]
%In this case, by adding a couple of guard constraint, we somehow made explicit the nature of the disjointness as coming from Y, allowing us
%to propagate it into S1,S2.
%This, or perhaps, more likely, we reconstructed the disjointness between S1 and S2 based on their opposite polarity on Y.
